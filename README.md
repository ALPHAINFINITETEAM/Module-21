# Module-21
Advanced Solidity

As a prominent fintech professional,i am assigned to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. I’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
